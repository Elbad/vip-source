# Source Code for the Book, *Odds & Ends*

This repo contains the source code for a textbook, *Odds & Ends: Introducing Probability & Decision with a Visual Emphasis*. The book is for introductory philosophy courses on probability and inductive logic, and is based on a typical such course I teach at the University of Toronto.

You can read the book in [HTML here](http://jonathanweisberg.org/vip/) or [PDF here](http://jonathanweisberg.org/vip/_main.pdf).
